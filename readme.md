# Causal Discovery Python Implementation

Hi, there! üëã I'm a student studying Causal Discovery, and this page is created to share my implemented codes. All the codes here are implemented by using only *numpy, scipy, pandas*, and *matplotlib*.

While studying Causal Discovery, I found that there were few proper code implementation examples online. Most of the code online used pre-existing package, such as networkx, dowhy, cdt, etc., which made it difficult to understand how the underlying algorithm **really** worked. (There is also a way to read the package code, but it is usually too complicated. üòì) As a result, I decided to implement the code myself based on research papers and books.

I share my code for the people who prefer to study while implementing the code themselves, rather than relying on pre-existing package. I recommend to follow **Implementation Procedure** below. I hope that my work will be helpful for you. üòÅ

## **I recommend it to people like this!**

- **Who wants to understand Causal Discovery algorithms while implementing them** üë¶
- **Who wants to implement their own algorithm by modifying pre-existing algorithms** üë©

## Implementation Procedure


### 1Ô∏è‚É£ DAG Pattern

‚ùó **We don't use networkx. We will implement our own graph class. Visualization, too**
